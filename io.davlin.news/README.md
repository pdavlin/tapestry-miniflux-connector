Read your unread articles from Miniflux directly in your Tapestry timeline.

## About Miniflux

[Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) is a minimalist and opinionated RSS/Atom feed reader. This connector allows you to integrate your Miniflux instance with Tapestry, bringing your unread articles into a unified timeline.

## Features

- ✅ Connect to any Miniflux instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- ✅ Display unread articles in chronological order
- ✅ Filter articles by category
- ✅ Customize the number of articles to fetch
- ✅ Mark articles as read directly from Tapestry
- ✅ View article metadata (author, feed, category)
- ✅ Full HTML content support

## Installation

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

If you have the `io.davlin.news.tapestry` file:

1. Save the file to your iPhone/iPad (e.g., in the Files app)
2. Open **Tapestry** on your device
3. Go to **Settings** → **Connectors**
4. Tap **Add a Connector**
5. Select the `io.davlin.news.tapestry` file
6. Configure your Miniflux instance details

### Manual Installation (For Development)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `io.davlin.news` folder to your Tapestry Connectors directory
3. In Tapestry, go to Settings > Connectors
4. Add a new "Miniflux" connector
5. Configure your Miniflux instance details

## Configuration

### Required Settings

- **Miniflux Instance URL**: The full URL of your Miniflux instance
  - Example: `https://your-instance.miniflux.app`
  - Example: `https://splendid-ladybug.pikapod.net`
  - Make sure to include `https://` and remove any trailing slash

- **API Token**: Your Miniflux API token
  - Generate an API token in Miniflux settings (Settings → API Keys)
  - API tokens provide secure authentication without exposing your password

### Optional Settings

- **Category ID**: Filter articles by Miniflux category
  - Enter `0` to fetch articles from all categories (default)
  - Enter a specific category ID to filter by that category
  - Find category IDs in Miniflux: Settings → Categories (the ID is in the URL when editing)

- **Number of articles to fetch**: Maximum number of unread articles to retrieve
  - Default: 500
  - Note: Only articles from the last 30 days are fetched for performance

## How It Works

### Authentication

The connector uses the X-Auth-Token header with your API token to connect to your Miniflux instance. Your API token is securely stored by Tapestry and sent with each API request.

### Loading Articles

When you refresh your Tapestry timeline, the connector:

1. Connects to your Miniflux instance using your credentials
2. Fetches unread articles based on your configuration
3. Converts each article to a Tapestry timeline item
4. Displays them in chronological order (newest first)

### Article Information

Each article displays:

- **Title**: The article headline
- **Date**: Publication date
- **Author**: Article author (if available)
- **Content**: Full HTML content from the feed
- **Source**: The RSS feed name and website
- **Category**: The Miniflux category (if assigned)

### Marking as Read

You can mark articles as read directly from Tapestry:

1. Open the article actions menu
2. Select "Mark as Read"
3. The article will be marked as read in your Miniflux instance
4. On next refresh, the article will no longer appear in your timeline

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error

- Double-check your API token is correct
- Ensure your Miniflux account is active
- Generate a new API token in Miniflux settings (Settings → API Keys) if needed

### "Miniflux instance not found" error

- Verify your instance URL is correct
- Make sure to include `https://`
- Remove any trailing slashes from the URL
- Check that your instance is accessible from your device

### No articles appearing

- Make sure you have unread articles in Miniflux
- Try increasing the article limit
- Check the Tapestry console for error messages

### Articles not marked as read

- Ensure you have write permissions in Miniflux
- Check your internet connection
- Try manually marking the article as read in Miniflux to verify it's not a permissions issue

## API Reference

This connector uses the following Miniflux API endpoints:

- `GET /v1/me` - Verify authentication
- `GET /v1/entries` - Fetch unread articles (supports `category_id` filter)
- `PUT /v1/entries` - Mark articles as read

For more information, see the [Miniflux API Documentation](https://miniflux.app/docs/api.html).

## Privacy & Security

- Your Miniflux credentials are stored securely by Tapestry
- All communication with Miniflux uses HTTPS encryption
- No data is sent to third parties
- The connector only reads and updates article read status
